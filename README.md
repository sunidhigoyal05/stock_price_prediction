# Stock Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains a project focused on predicting stock prices of 4 companies. The analysis evaluates the  relationship between the stock prices of companies. The conclusions drawn from the analysis suggest potential opportunities for portfolio diversification for investors.

## Methodology

### Data Analysis

- Explored the dataset to identify patterns and trends.
- Observed a strong linear relationship between the stock prices of Company A and Company B.
- Conducted residual analysis to ensure the assumptions of error analysis were satisfied.


### Stock Price Indicators

The analysis considered the following indicators:

- **Moving Averages:** Checked the 12 and 26-day moving averages of the stock prices.
- **Volatility:** Assessed the volatility of the stock prices.
- **The moving avergae convergence divergence:** The moving avergae convergence divergence is used for assessing the relationship between two moving averages. We typically calculate it by finding the difference between the 26 day moving average and the 12 day moving average. 
When Moving Average 12 is generally higher than the moving average 26, then we can say that we see an indication of upward momentum (bullish signal), and vice versa (bearish signal).

## Conclusion

Given the identified relationship between the stock prices of Company A and Company B, investors may find an opportunity to diversify their portfolio. Instead of investing all funds in one company, partial investments in both companies could provide similar interests, returns, and risks.
